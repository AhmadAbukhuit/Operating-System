# CPU-Scheduling-Longest-Job-First

I implement a simple OS scheduler using C++. 

The schedulerâ€™s task is to receive a set of processes and their details, and then decide the order of executing these processes based on the Longest Job First (LJF) algorithm. 

This made-up algorithm is the exact opposite of the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm 

Finally, the scheduler will output the order of process execution, in addition to some stats about each of the processes.
